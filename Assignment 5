We will use a simple list to store the numbers, conditional statements to check for certain conditions, and functions to encapsulate the different tasks.
Here's a basic example of a Python program that accomplishes this:
```python
def get_numbers():
    numbers = []
    while True:
        try:
            num = float(input("Enter a number (or type 'done' to finish): "))
            numbers.append(num)
        except ValueError:
            break
    return numbers
def calculate_statistics(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    average = total / len(numbers) if numbers else 0
    max_num = max(numbers) if numbers else None
    min_num = min(numbers) if numbers else None
    return total, average, max_num, min_num
def main():
    numbers = get_numbers()
    total, average, max_num, min_num = calculate_statistics(numbers)
    print("\nStatistics:")
    print(f"Total: {total}")
    print(f"Average: {average}")
    print(f"Maximum: {max_num}")
    print(f"Minimum: {min_num}")
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
In this program:
- The `get_numbers` function prompts the user to input numbers and adds them to a list until the user enters "done".
- The `calculate_statistics` function takes a list of numbers and calculates the total, average, maximum, and minimum values.
- The `main` function calls `get_numbers` to obtain the list of numbers, then calls `calculate_statistics` to process the numbers and finally prints out the statistics.
